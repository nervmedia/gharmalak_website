              after you opt in to that round.

              If you ask to talk to an owner or for written answers about a building, we keep your
              name, WhatsApp number, the building and when you plan to decide, to set up your call
              or send the answers. Owners never see your number, and we connect calls without
              showing either side&apos;s number.

            <p className="text-base text-[#073B30]/85 leading-relaxed">
              If you answer as an owner, we keep your name, WhatsApp number, building and answers.
              Your answers are shared with homebuyers without your name, phone or flat number. The
              sale agreement, Index II or bill you send as proof is used only to check that you own
              a flat there, and is deleted within 30 days.
